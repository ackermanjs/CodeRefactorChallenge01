# CodeRefactorChallenge01
This repo contains the code for the Code Refactor Challenge 01.

For this assignment, we were asked to take an existing piece of code, which in this case was a landing page for a website, and slightly modify it to be more accessible.

In my efforts to format the landing page's HTML to be more accessible I made a series of small changes.
My changes include:
- Added Alt text descriptions for the images.
- Added a website title.
- Replaced some of the DIVs with semantic wrappers such as Header, Nav, Section and Footer.

This assignment led me to research the topic of website accessibilty as it was not a concept I was previopusly aware of, however it makes sense. I realize now that we must approach our projects with an understanding that some pepole that may access the project could potentially need extra assistance from something like a reader.

The code can be accessed on my GitHub Repo via the following link:
